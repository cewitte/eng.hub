        coaching: First of all, I need to say that Otavio's proactivity in fixing ticket issues that are beyond his duties is much appreciated. This is one of the characteristics of a top performer - taking responsibility. Exactly for this reason, I think this entry is more of a question than a feedback, in a sense that it is not clear whether this apt-get install command would fix the script issue signaled by David. If I read this ticket a year from now, it would look like this ticket was closed too early because there was a possible fix pointed out by Otavio. That's why I am in this cruzade for better documentation of our work. That being said, I cannot blame neither David and much less Otavio, because the ticket should have been closed anyway for not passing our IQB. It is not our responsibility to fix the yamls, it might be even risky sometimes, but I trust David and Otavio would not fix it without the PCA's validation on the changes. Either way, the PCA would not be available for any fixes or validation until mid November, long passed the SLA for Eng.Problem tickets.
