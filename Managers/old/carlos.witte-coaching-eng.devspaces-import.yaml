        coaching: Please make sure that all the Sub-Tasks are resolved before moving the ticket to Done status because this prevents us from closing the weekly Sprint.

        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/SLIAO-6918
        coaching: Perfect QE Review with no warnings, documentation is good enough, but can improve. Statement "PR has been merged" makes the value added clear for those who have no access to repo and PR.

        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/SLIAO-6971
        coaching: Decision history is not clear, ticket probably lacks enough documentation. QE Review good enough to get approval, but better watch out because you are getting frequently flagged by QE due to issues with the Dockerfile Optimal Layers.
