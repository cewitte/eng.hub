        coaching: One thing that looks weird to me is why some review tickets have the Feasibility Check table and others don't. Is there a criteria that QEPA (QE Process Automation) uses or could this be a version thing? Maybe a bug? I have no issues whatsoever about the process or the ticket, both are great, but we have to make a definitive decision about this table, which seems to be outdated and appearing randomly. My perception might be wrong, let's clarify.
