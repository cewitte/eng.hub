        coaching: It seems we haven't reviewed our templates in a while and the maintenance team is picking small issues in our documentation. I'm asking Otavio to please update the README.md in our templates to':' 1) Make sure that step 6 is clear about the need to run the command inside the container. 2) Let's move the video to a devspaces-import-artifacts GitHub repository (I was not aware that Aurea51 was only for Aureans).
        perfrormanceAssessment: topPerformer # there is no rank info on R&R because the team has only 1 IC, hence this is my personal evaluation.
