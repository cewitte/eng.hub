        coaching: It's good to see that QE tickets won't be empty anymore. I understand that the relevant information goes in the parent Import ticket and that duplicating the information would not add any value, therefore I don't think there is much more relevant information to be added other than what you've added. I would just add "QEPA is closing this ticket automatically" to make clear that the review was completed by the automation tool and not the QE Reviewer himself.
