    description: Improve our JQLs in the Engineering Systems Metrics spreadsheet, XO's Metrics App and other automated spreadsheets to prevent major metrics impacts when wrong transitions are performed (as happened during the weekend), e.g. from Jira status Done (resolved) to Jira status Closed (also resolved) because the orders were cancelled.
    effort: 2 # 2 days between fixing JQL, submit ticket to revert transitions and fix metrics data
    impact: 7.50 # 3 hours (from 40 hours week) are necessary to fix mistakes caused by wrong transitions
