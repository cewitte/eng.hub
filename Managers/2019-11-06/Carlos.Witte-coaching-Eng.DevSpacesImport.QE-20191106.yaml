        coaching: I'm asking Otavio to double check whether IPA (our automation tool) is already creating README.md files with the new template that is more clear about the need to execute steps 6 and 7 inside the container. Not all team members are aware of the change, so I'm also asking Otavio to communicate it properly to the team.
        perfrormanceAssessment: topPerformer # there is no rank info on R&R because the team has only 1 IC, hence this is my personal evaluation.
