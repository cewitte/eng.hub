        coaching: David should check with Otavio why IPA did not generate the README.md linked above with the new template. The new template makes clearer that steps 6 and 7 have to be executed inside the container.

        coaching: As Pinkal pointed out correctly in our team channel in Mattermost, GTM and SchoolLoop might face the same issues when they arrive in maintenance. Having passed the SchoolLoop Web crisis, I'm asking Pinkal to contact GTM's PCA to make sure we set the expectations clear and that we will get all the necessary importOrder.yaml files to create the development environment.

        unit: https://github.com/trilogy-group/think3-sli-templatebuilder-mongodb/blob/master/devspaces/README.md
        coaching: Rafael is not aware of changes we are doing to the README.md template acting upon the maintenance team's feedback. The new template should include in steps 6 and 7 (step 7 was not necessary for this unit, though) that the commands should be executed inside the container. Rafael should make sure that his next READMEs generated by IPA will include this change or report this problem to DevSpacesImport.QE.

        coaching: I am not arbitrarily assigning the remaining SchoolLoop tickets that arrived today. Given SchoolLoop's urgency, I am letting Stefan to choose the tickets he can deliver faster based on his technical expertise and familiarity. However, I changed the Sprint to this week's Sprint in Jira (week 45). I expect Stefan to make his choice and start working on the tickets asap. If Stefan thinks he can't deliver them on time, he has the freedom to reassign part of the tickets to his colleagues with max priority without having to wait for my arrival at work (Stefan starts his day 5 or 6 hours before me due to time zone differences).
