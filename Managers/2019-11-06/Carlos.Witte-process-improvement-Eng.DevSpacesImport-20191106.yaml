    description: Our automation tool - IPA, Import Process Automation - generates customized README.md files as part of our deliverable items. Based upon the maintenance team's feedback, it seems to be unclear that steps 6 and 7 of the instructions in the README have to be performed inside the container. Hence I'm asking Otavio, our QE CA who is responsible for our automation tools, to update the template today (2019-11-06), so all the orders completed from now ow will have this improved README.md file. It's a minor and easy change, but IMHO worth putting in writing for future reference.
    effort: 1 # actually, much less than a day, about 30 minutes to update the template and perform tests.
    impact: 0.00 # There is no CpU impact, but it is an action taken upon feedback that is meant to improve the quality of our deliverable items.
